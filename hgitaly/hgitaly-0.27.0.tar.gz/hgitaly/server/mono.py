"""Server startup logic, mono process and mono thread.

Can be used as a standalone server (e.g, for debugging purposes) or as
a worker in a service with multiple processes.

While the exposition as a Mercurial extension is certainly convenient for
many reasons, it is best to separate what is specific to the extension context
and what is just generic gRPC server code.

Note that gRPC will launch several threads no matter what, but only one will
be active at a given time.
